Reference DotNetCore Console Service with a simple Calculator 

This projects tries to document creating a dotnet core console app.
The goal is to have a development, staging  and production context on MacOS, Linux and Windows.

## Step 1:

create new github project
clone it to your dev directory

### Perform

```bash
dotnet new console
dotnet run
```

In Visual Studio Code you now have a development environment with runs (and has debugging) on F5.

## Step 2 Add GitFlow to the project

I use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to add [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) support to the project.
